Hello Chris-chan,

To install the dependencies for this epic demonstration, do

$ make install-deps

This will invoke `sudo apt-get' to install the necessary dependencies.
They are small libraries, plus a recent version of g++ to compile.

To build the demo, do

$ make

To run the demo do

$ ./most-illustrious-of-cubes

The command

$ make clean

Will clean up the object files for you afterwards.

With L0ve,
  Matt
